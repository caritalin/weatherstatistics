# Final Project
IoT and Web Development

Follow the project instructions in Dropbox.


Project Documentation:


Weather page works as requirement states that in the View 1 (Last Values) the user should be able to choose which time span and measurement they want to see and the page updates itself according to that. My page don't have any button for submit the changes, it delivers the data itself. All the options work and you can use it easily because the column highlights when you bring youre mouse over it.

View 2 (Humidity), 3 (Temperature) and 4 (Wind Speed) are similar between each other. They all give the user the opportunity to choose the time span they want the data from. They all also show chart of the chosen and statistics of mean, median, mode, range and standard deviation. Statistics data is collected with seperate javascript file that collects the data for all different datas. All the data updates when you change the options.

Weather page is compatible with mobile and tablet devices.

When you change the screen width to smaller, the top navigation bar changes to hamburger for easier use.

I've made sure that every clock time and measurement is in reasonable readings as 2 digit numbers and time has no seconds.

Charts are easy to use because user can move their mouse over the specific time span to find out what the direct reading is.

I was a bit disappointed of the TAMK cloud data which we are using in this project, because it won't give any correct weather data. I hope that this is recognized in the grading that we aren't able to do anyhting to this problem.


My weather page project holds in every phase 1-5 requirements. I have done it with the goal to have all the 74 points collected so my final success percent would be 100% and worth of 5p. I also hope that my 1 extra view with of wind speed with statistics and chart data and also compatibility with mobile devices could give me some bonus points. The project is also published in GitHub Pages that should give me 5 bonus points.
